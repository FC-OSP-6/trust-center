```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run both server and client concurrently
npm run dev
```

**Or run separately:**

# Terminal 1 - Start server only
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Start client only
npm run dev:client
```

**Verify:**
- Client runs at http://localhost:5173
- Server runs at http://localhost:4000
